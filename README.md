VeloSpot is an Android application that helps cyclists discover and navigate to bike parking facilities **across Germany, France and Luxembourg**. Powered by a pre-bundled OpenStreetMap dataset with over **100 000 locations**, the app works fully offline from the very first launch — no network required to find parking.

## 🗺️ Multi-Country Bike Parking Data

VeloSpot ships with pre-bundled OpenStreetMap extracts covering **Germany 🇩🇪, France 🇫🇷 and Luxembourg 🇱🇺**.

- **~100 000+ bicycle parking locations** extracted from the OSM datasets for Germany, France and Luxembourg
- **Fully offline** — all data is bundled inside the app as a Room/SQLite asset (one DB per country, merged on first launch)
- **Instant startup** — no network call needed to see parking spots
- **Viewport-based loading** — only the markers visible in the current map area are queried, keeping memory usage low even with 100 000+ entries
- **Marker clustering** — at city-level zoom dense areas are aggregated into native MapLibre clusters for smooth panning and zooming; tapping a cluster zooms in to break it apart
- **Lazy reverse geocoding** — when you tap a marker without a stored address, Nominatim is queried once, the result is cached locally and shown immediately in the details sheet
- **Extraction script included** (`scripts/extract_osm_parking.py`) — regenerate the bundled database from a fresh Geofabrik PBF at any time

## ✨ Highlights

- **Multi-country** bike parking data from OpenStreetMap (~100 000+ locations across Germany, France and Luxembourg)
- **Fully offline** after install — no network calls required to find parking
- OpenStreetMap-based map browsing with **MapLibre vector tiles** and custom bike markers
- Viewport-based marker loading — smooth performance even across whole countries
- **Marker clustering** — nearby parking pins are merged into clusters at low zoom for a fast, uncluttered map; tap a cluster to zoom in
- Lazy address resolution via Nominatim (cached permanently to local DB)
- Red marker highlighting for favorite parking spots
- Orange marker highlighting for currently selected parking space
- Dedicated favorites sheet with direct navigation shortcuts
- Smooth animated map camera transitions powered by MapLibre's built-in easing
- Current-location recentering and location marker support
- In-app dark mode toggle from the top-right menu — **including dark map tiles** that turn the whole vector map dark
- **🆕 Toggle map layers** — show or hide pin categories (parking, favorites, saved places) from an intuitive layers sheet; the choice is persisted
- **🆕 Saved places** — save any tapped location as a named favorite; it appears as a persistent green star marker and in the favorites list
- **In-app bike route navigation** with live route overlay (no external map app handoff)
- **🆕 Live 3D turn-by-turn navigation** — a Google-Maps-style 3D follow camera (60° pitch, heading-up, speed-dependent zoom), snap-to-route map matching, a rotating heading arrow, live remaining-distance/ETA, a greyed-out travelled path, 3D buildings, and automatic off-route rerouting
- **🆕 2D / 3D map view switch** — choose a flat top-down map or a tilted 3D view (with extruded buildings) for the resting map; the choice is persisted. Navigation itself is always 3D
- **Navigation focus mode**: non-target parking markers become smaller, lighter gray, and more transparent while navigation is active
- **8 languages** with persistent in-app language picker (DE 🇩🇪 EN 🇬🇧 FR 🇫🇷 IT 🇮🇹 PT 🇵🇹 LB 🇱🇺 NL 🇳🇱 ES 🇪🇸)
- **🆕 Address search** — type any address in Germany, France or Luxembourg into the floating search bar and jump straight to the location; results are biased toward your current surroundings. Tap a result to drop a pin and start in-app BRouter navigation, save it as a favourite, or remove the pin (same sheet as a custom pin)
- **🆕 Tap-to-place custom pin** — tap any empty spot on the map to drop a blue pin; the address is resolved automatically via Nominatim reverse geocoding and a bottom sheet lets you start navigation directly to that point
- **🆕 BRouter offline routing** — routes calculated entirely on-device with 5 cycling profiles; no internet needed after the one-time segment download

### Regenerating the Bundled Database

The parking database is pre-generated and committed to `app/src/main/assets/`. To regenerate it from a fresh OSM extract:

```bash
pip install osmium requests
cd scripts/
python extract_osm_parking.py --pbf germany-latest.osm.pbf
# → writes ../app/src/main/assets/bike_parking_germany.db
# repeat with the France and Luxembourg PBFs to refresh those datasets
```

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for full details on the extraction pipeline, including how to download the per-country PBFs from Geofabrik.

## 📊 Data Sources

VeloSpot bundles bike parking data extracted from OpenStreetMap and displays it on OpenStreetMap tiles:

- **Bike Parking Data**: OpenStreetMap contributors (Germany, France & Luxembourg extracts via [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe.html))
- **Data format**: Pre-processed SQLite asset (Room-compatible)
- **Update frequency**: Bundled at build time; regenerate with `extract_osm_parking.py` for fresh data
- **Reverse Geocoding**: [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) (on-demand, cached, OSM-based)
- **Map Tiles**: OpenFreeMap vector tiles (Liberty style, [openfreemap.org](https://openfreemap.org/)) rendered via MapLibre

## 🎨 UI Components

### Map Screen
- Centered map view with bike parking markers
- **Marker clustering** — at low zoom, nearby pins merge into count bubbles; tapping a cluster animates the camera in to its expansion zoom. The selected spot and active navigation destination stay visible on a dedicated non-clustered layer
- **Address search bar** (top of screen) — live Nominatim forward geocoding with 400 ms debounce; results shown in a dropdown; tap a result to drop a pin and open the **same sheet as a custom pin** (`CustomMapPinSheet`) with "Navigate here", "Save as favourite" and "Remove pin" actions
- **Tap-to-place custom pin** — tap any empty map location to drop a blue pin; `CustomMapPinSheet` shows the reverse-geocoded address and a "Navigate here" action; pin remains visible as route end-point during active navigation
- Zoom-responsive marker scaling
- Favorite-aware marker colors
- Current location marker and recenter action
- Top-right quick menu with favorites, language picker, and dark mode toggle
- Menu button and search bar vertically aligned in the same row for a clean, consistent header
- In-app routing polyline, destination highlight, and route status card (distance/time)
- **Live 3D navigation mode** — a tilted (60°) follow camera that snaps the position onto the BRouter route, rotates with the heading, zooms with speed, greys out the travelled path, raises 3D buildings, shows live remaining distance/ETA, and reroutes automatically when you go off-route
- Navigation focus styling that dims non-target markers (smaller, lighter gray, and more transparent)
- Error handling and loading states

### Parking Details Sheet
- Bottom sheet with parking information
- Address auto-resolved via Nominatim if not present in OSM data
- Capacity and operator details when available
- Full-width "Save as favourite" / "Remove from favourites" button
- Quick-access navigation button

### Favorites Sheet
- Dedicated list of saved bike parking spots
- Separate actions per saved location: start navigation or show spot details
- Empty-state guidance for first-time use

### Language Picker
- Flag-based selection for 8 supported languages
- Selection persists across app restarts and cold starts

## 🧪 Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

Run instrumented tests:
```bash
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## 🔐 CI & Branch Protection

The repository uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Rulesets to enforce safe merges on `main`:

- Required CI checks: `ci-build` and `ci-test`
- Pull requests are required for `main`
- At least one approval is required
- Stale reviews are dismissed on new commits
- Review threads must be resolved
- Non-fast-forward updates and branch deletion are blocked
- Linear history is enforced

Renovate is configured so that only security-related dependency updates can be automerged.

Recent Renovate dependency and tooling updates are documented in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) under `Unreleased`.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Network Timeout
Edit `core/di/NetworkModule.kt` to adjust API request timeouts.

### Default Map Location
Modify constants in `feature/map/presentation/MainMapScreen.kt`:
```kotlin
private const val TRIER_LAT = 49.7596
private const val TRIER_LON = 6.6441
private const val DEFAULT_ZOOM = 14.0
```

## 📦 Build & Release

### Debug Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Release Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Generated APK location: `app/build/outputs/apk/`

## 🗒 Changelog

Project history and notable milestones are documented in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "JAVA_HOME not set"
```bash
# On Windows
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr
```

### App crashes on startup
- Ensure location permissions are granted
- Check that the asset database `bike_parking_germany.db` is present under `app/src/main/assets/`

### No parking markers visible after fresh install
- On the very first launch Room copies the ~20 MB asset database — this takes a second or two; wait briefly and the markers will appear
- If upgrading from a previous version: uninstall the old app first so Room copies the fresh asset (or use `adb shell run-as de.velospot rm databases/velospot_database.db` on debug builds)

### Map shows blank
- The MapLibre map style is loaded from [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/) on first launch — a brief internet connection is required to cache the vector tile style
- After the style is cached, the map renders offline; only tile data for new map areas requires a network call
- No API key or registration is required

### My Location does not work
- Confirm location permission is granted for the app
- Make sure location services are enabled on the device
- Try tapping the floating action button again after Android shows the permission dialog

### Address shows "—" for a parking spot
- Address resolution happens the first time you tap a marker; it requires a brief network call to Nominatim
- After the first tap the address is cached permanently in the local database

### Address search returns no results
- Make sure you have a network connection; forward geocoding queries Nominatim live
- Results are restricted to the covered countries (Germany, France, Luxembourg) — addresses elsewhere will not appear
- Try a more specific query (e.g. include the city name)
