VeloSpot is an Android application that helps cyclists discover and navigate to bike parking facilities **anywhere in Germany**. Powered by a pre-bundled OpenStreetMap dataset with over **100 000 locations**, the app works fully offline from the very first launch — no network required to find parking.

## 🇩🇪 Germany-Wide Coverage — Now Live!

> **This release replaces the previous Trier-only WFS/WMS data source with a pre-bundled OpenStreetMap extract covering all of Germany.**

- **~100 000+ bicycle parking locations** extracted from the OSM Germany dataset
- **Fully offline** — all data is bundled inside the APK as a Room/SQLite asset
- **Instant startup** — no network call needed to see parking spots
- **Viewport-based loading** — only the markers visible in the current map area are queried, keeping memory usage low even with 100 000 entries
- **Lazy reverse geocoding** — when you tap a marker without a stored address, Nominatim is queried once, the result is cached locally and shown immediately in the details sheet
- **Extraction script included** (`scripts/extract_osm_parking.py`) — regenerate the bundled database from a fresh Geofabrik PBF at any time

## 📥 Download

Pre-built debug APKs are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/drzeeb/VeloSpot/releases/latest).

1. Download the latest `VeloSpot-vX.X.X-debug.apk`
2. On your Android device: **Settings → Install unknown apps** → allow your browser or file manager
3. Open the APK and tap **Install**

New releases are built automatically by GitHub Actions whenever a version tag is pushed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Jellyfish or newer)
- Java Development Kit (JDK 17+)
- Android SDK 37+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drzeeb/VeloSpot.git
   cd VeloSpot
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - File → Open
   - Select the VeloSpot directory
   - Android Studio will automatically detect and configure the project

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. **Run on device or emulator**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew installDebug
   adb shell am start -n de.velospot/de.velospot.MainActivity
   ```

### Regenerating the Bundled Database

The parking database is pre-generated and committed to `app/src/main/assets/`. To regenerate it from a fresh OSM extract:

```bash
pip install osmium requests
cd scripts/
python extract_osm_parking.py --pbf germany-latest.osm.pbf
# → writes ../app/src/main/assets/bike_parking_germany.db
```

See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for full details on the extraction pipeline, including how to download the PBF from Geofabrik.

## 📊 Data Sources

VeloSpot bundles bike parking data extracted from OpenStreetMap and displays it on OpenStreetMap tiles:

- **Bike Parking Data**: OpenStreetMap contributors (Germany extract via [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany.html))
- **Data format**: Pre-processed SQLite asset (Room-compatible)
- **Update frequency**: Bundled at build time; regenerate with `extract_osm_parking.py` for fresh data
- **Reverse Geocoding**: [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/) (on-demand, cached, OSM-based)
- **Map Tiles**: OpenStreetMap contributors
- **Map License**: Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL 1.0)
- **Attribution**: © OpenStreetMap contributors

```

## 🔐 CI & Branch Protection

The repository uses GitHub Actions and GitHub Rulesets to enforce safe merges on `main`:

- Required CI checks: `ci-build` and `ci-test`
- Pull requests are required for `main`
- At least one approval is required
- Stale reviews are dismissed on new commits
- Review threads must be resolved
- Non-fast-forward updates and branch deletion are blocked
- Linear history is enforced

Renovate is configured so that only security-related dependency updates can be automerged.

Recent Renovate dependency and tooling updates are documented in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) under `Unreleased`.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Network Timeout
Edit `core/di/NetworkModule.kt` to adjust API request timeouts.

### Default Map Location
Modify constants in `feature/map/presentation/MainMapScreen.kt`:
```kotlin
private const val TRIER_LAT = 49.7596
private const val TRIER_LON = 6.6441
private const val DEFAULT_ZOOM = 14.0
```

## 📦 Build & Release

### Debug Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

### Release Build
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Generated APK location: `app/build/outputs/apk/`

## 🗒 Changelog

Project history and notable milestones are documented in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "JAVA_HOME not set"
```bash
# On Windows
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr
```

### App crashes on startup
- Ensure location permissions are granted
- Check that the asset database `bike_parking_germany.db` is present under `app/src/main/assets/`

### No parking markers visible after fresh install
- On the very first launch Room copies the ~20 MB asset database — this takes a second or two; wait briefly and the markers will appear
- If upgrading from a previous version: uninstall the old app first so Room copies the fresh asset (or use `adb shell run-as de.velospot rm databases/velospot_database.db` on debug builds)

### Map shows blank
- Ensure OSM tiles are loading (check network tab)
- Verify `userAgentValue` is set in `BaseApplication.kt`

### My Location does not work
- Confirm location permission is granted for the app
- Make sure location services are enabled on the device
- Try tapping the floating action button again after Android shows the permission dialog

### Address shows "—" for a parking spot
- Address resolution happens the first time you tap a marker; it requires a brief network call to Nominatim
- After the first tap the address is cached permanently in the local database
